\chapter{Weighted Problems}\label{chapter:weighted}
In this chapter, we discuss the \textbf{NP-Hardness} of a few weighted problems. In weighted problems, 
there is a weighting function $w$ over a set $S$. The problems ask about whether the weight of this elements 
in $S$ fulfill a equality or inequality relationship. The weighted problems are also mathematical programming 
problems, which is another large discipline of \NPH\ problems. In Karp's paper, there were \XC, \SBS \footnote{What Karp presented was referred to as Knapsack, although
the definition is closer to the subset sum nowadays}, and \KN introduced. 
We present reductions from \XC\ to \SBS, from \SBS\ to \Part, \KN and \IP. 

\section{Subset sum}
We define the subset sum problem with a set and a weighting function. There are also a few alternative definitions using a multiset or a list without 
a weighting function, which is useful for our other reductions. More details follow in the number partition section. 
\problem{\SBS}{A finite set $S$, a weighting function $w$, and an integer $B$}{Is there a subset $S' \subseteq S$ s.t. 
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{x \in S'} w(x) = B
\end{align*}}

\subsection{Reduction Details}
We reduce the exact cover problem to the subset sum. We start with the exact cover problem over the sets of natural numbers. 
Given $(X, S)$ an exact cover instance over natural numbers, let $S$ be the set in the entry of the subset sum problem. Then we
define the weighting function $w$ and the sum $B$ by 
\begin{align*}
    w(s) = \sum_{x \in s} |S|^x , B = w(X)
\end{align*}
The triple $(S, w, B)$ is then an input for the subset sum problem.
\begin{lemma}[Soundness]
    If $(X, S)$ is an instance of the exact cover. The reduced $(S, w, B)$ is then an instance of the subset sum problem. 
\end{lemma}
Apparently, the reduction is sound. Let the $S' \subseteq S$ be an exact cover of X. It then holds that
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{s \in S'} w(s) = \sum_{s \in S'} (\sum_{x \in s} |S|^x) = \sum_{x \in \bigcup S'} |S|^x = \sum_{x \in X} |S|^x = B
\end{align*}
\begin{lemma}[Completeness]
    Let $(S, w, B)$ be reduced from $(X, S)$. If $(S, w, B)$ is a subset sum instance, $(X, S)$ has to be an exact cover instance. 
\end{lemma}
The proof of the completeness is unfortunately trivial. However, it suffices to show that
