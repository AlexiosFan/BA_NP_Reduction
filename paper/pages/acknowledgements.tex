Firstly, I would like to thank Prof. Tobias Nipkow, who gave me the opportunity to work on this work 
and introduced Isabelle to me. Then, I want to thank my advisor, Katharina Kreuzer,
for all the meaningful instructions and dedicated guidance she offered. 
It has been a great pleasure to work with her. 
I also want to thank Simon Rosskopf and Kevin Kappelmann, who more or less helped in finding this topic 
and gave some helpful advices about the ongoing project. \\\\
Additionally, I want to thank my parents for their support of my studies in Germany. 
I also want to thank my brother Zichun for sample reading this thesis and providing some insights 
from the perspective of a mathematician.
