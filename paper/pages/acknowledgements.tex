Firstly, I would like to thank Prof. Tobias Nipkow, who gave me the opportunity to work on this work 
and introduced Isabelle to me. Then, I want to thank my advisor, Katharina Kreuzer,
for all the meaningful instructions and dedicated guidance she offered. 
It has been a great pleasure to work with her. 
I also want to thank Simon Rosskopf and Kevin Kappelmann, who more or less helped me find this topic 
and gave some helpful advice about the ongoing project. \\\\
Furthermore, I want to thank my parents for their support for my studies in Germany. 
I also want to thank my brother Zichun for proofreading this thesis. 
In addition, I would like to thank my friend Christian who gave me some insights into a step of formalisation.
In the end, I also want to thank all my friends who helped me improve this work and gave constructive advice.
