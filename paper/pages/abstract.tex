NP-hardness is a widely discussed topic in the theoretical computer science. Since the publishing of the Cook-Levin-theorem in the early 1970s, the researchers have proved the NP-hardness of many problems. Among many NP-hard problems, the most famous are the 21 NP-complete problems given by Karp in the paper \textit{Reducibility of Combinatorical Problems}, for it covers a considerable amount of NP-hard problems from various mathematical disciplines. \\
The proofs of the NP-hardness, however, were limited on-paper. With the existence of the interactive theorem provers, it is possible to reproduce and verify the proofs with the aid of computers. In order to demonstrate the capability of interactive theorem provers in verifying the NP-hardness, we formalized and verified a few NP-hard problems using the well-known interactive theorem prover, Isabelle.
