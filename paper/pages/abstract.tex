NP-hardness is a fundamental concept in the complexity theory. It represents a class of problems that 
are hard to be computed by a polynomial-time algorithm. Polynomial-time reductions are used 
to classify the NP-hardness of such problems. While proofs of the correctness of the polynomial-time reductions 
were limited to pen-and-paper proofs, 
it is now possible to reproduce and verify these proofs with the aid of computers. 
In order to demonstrate the capability of interactive theorem provers in verifying NP-hardness, 
we formalised and verified the NP-hardness of six selected problems using 
the well-known interactive theorem prover, Isabelle.
