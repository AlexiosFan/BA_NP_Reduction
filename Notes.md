# Notes from the previous reductions
  - Reduction definitions: NREST, *Polynomial_reduction.thy* *Reduction.thy* both in the repository of Karp21
  -  

# Notes from the documentation search
  ## reduction from vertex cover to exact cover 
  - [stackexchange](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/117658/how-to-prove-exact-cover-problem-is-np-complete-using-vertex-cover-problem)
  - [Latin square](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2638/paper26.pdf): reduction via the latin squares?

  ## reduction from 3-colorability to exact cover
  - Karp: a direct reduction from chromatic number
  - Cornell notes: a reduction from 3-colorability to chromatic numher, which probably suits the exsiting implementation, see literature at **page 17**, applicable approach: no worry about the type of the set

## Next meet time: 15.March, 10am.
