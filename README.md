Creation of the repository

## 01/03/2023
Starting to work on the basic setting. 
  - Included the poly-reduction repository as a dependency. 
  - Resolved some old errors in the subdirectory of Karp21. 
  - Resolved the dependency problems in the directory original_work, which is the
  workspace for the thesis project
